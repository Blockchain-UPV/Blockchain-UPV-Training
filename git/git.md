# Git

### Installing git
On many systems, this is already installed for you. Otherwise you can install it by downloading the [git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

You must also have a Github account. You can create an account on their [website](https://github.com).

### Git config

One setup item that is important is to tell Git who we are.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Username"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"
```
To have Github credit the changes to you, the username must match your Github username and the email must match the email you made Github with.
:::info
Alternatively, if you don't want to disclose your email, you can use a private email address provided by GitHub at [Settings -> Emails](https://github.com/settings/emails).
